## My Projects

___

<br>
<br>

- ### Tech Spotlight
  
  - A Web Scraper targeting Indeed.com built with Python. We wanted a tool that would grab the frequency at which technology terminology pops up. Weâ€™ve plotted the term occurrence data on a Jupyter notebook.
  - [Repo](https://github.com/regex-rejects/tech-spotlight)
  - [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/edenbrekke/tech-spotlight-indeed-data-18may2022/notebook)
  
- ### Do or DOOM

  - A task list application that allows a user to create tasks,set a due date, and add an accountability partner. If that task is not completed by the due date a text message is sent to your accountability partner. This application uses a next.js frontend and a Django backend with an ElephantSQL database.
